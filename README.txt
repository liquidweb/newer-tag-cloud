A small plugin providing a neat tag cloud feature. Inspired by New Tag Cloud.

== Description ==

Newer Tag Cloud is a WordPress plugin that generates a tag clouds. This plugin
was inspired by the original New Tag Cloud.

Newer Tag Cloud uses the WordPress own tagging feature, so that you don't need any tagging plugin. You can use New Tag Cloud directly as a shortcode in any post/page, as a widget, or in the theme as PHP code. Use it however you'd like, it's flexible!

The original New Tag Cloud had been without updates for 7 years this caused issues with modern WordPress versions. Due to the issues, for a short time, a privately updated version was created at Liquid Web. Now this small fix has been  turned into a complete code refactor. The results are now being released to the  community!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= So what does 'inspired by New Tag Cloud' mean exactly? =
Initially the plugin was created as a direct fork of New Tag Cloud, only used internally and not publically released. A
new version of the plugin was created based on the [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://wppb.io/) with common features
being implemented in Newer Tag Cloud.

= How to use vanilla PHP to add a Tag Cloud? =
If you want to use Newer Tag Cloud in your theme you can still use `<?php newerTagCloud() ?>`. If you want to use a specific widget you can provide the function an ID as parameter. For example, `<?php newerTagCloud(2) ?>` will result in the configuration using the instance provided.

= Using shortcodes to add a Tag Cloud? =
Simply add `[newer-tag-cloud]` or `[newer-tag-cloud int=<ID>]` to your post or page and the tag cloud will be shown there. If you use `[newer-tag-cloud]` the instances set as "Default instance for shortcode" is used. With int=<ID> set you can specify an instance to use. For example, this is useful if you need two, or more, different tag clouds generated via shortcode.

= Can I use multiple unique clouds? =
Yes. All "layout specific options" are stored in each instance. The instance has an ID which you can use to call it.
This feature allows you the place different tag clouds on your blog as needed.
